;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;;  This enhances the functionality of library `dired-details.el'.
;;
;;  1. It shrink-wraps Dired's frame whenever you show or hide
;;     details.  For this enhancement, you will need library
;;     `autofit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  2. It advises `dired-byte-compile', `dired-compress',
;;     `dired-create-files' and `dired-create-directory', so that
;;     whenever you create new files or directories or rename them the
;;     hide/show overlays are updated accordingly.
;;
;;  3. It adds user option `dired-details-propagate-flag' which, if
;;     non-nil, propagates the last state you chose to the next Dired
;;     buffer you open.
;;
;;  4. It binds both `)' and `(' to `dired-details-toggle'.
;;
;;  Perhaps #2 corresponds to this TO-DO item in `dired-details.el':
;;
;;    * add a hook for dired-add-file to hide new entries as necessary
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `dired-details.el'
;;              has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `dired-details-activate' - If `dired-details-propagate-flag' is
;;                             non-nil, then use the last state.
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following functions defined in `dired-aux.el' have
;;              been REDEFINED HERE (advised only):
;;
;;  `dired-byte-compile', `dired-compress', `dired-create-files',
;;  `dired-create-directory', `dired-do-chmod' - Update overlays.
;;
;;
;;  I have submitted these enhancements to Rob Giardina, the author of
;;  `dired-details.el', for inclusion in that library.  When they (or
;;  similar) are added to that library, I'll remove this library.
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;   (require 'dired-details+)
;;
;;  I also recommend customizing `dired-details-hidden-string' to use
;;  the value "" instead of the default "[...]" - less wasted space.
;;
;;  Note: This library also calls `dired-details-install', activating
;;  show/hide and binding keys `(' and `)'.
